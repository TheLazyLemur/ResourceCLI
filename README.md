# Resource Cli

Resource CLI is intended to be an easy way for developers to store information that they require easy access to, or even information that they would like to reference at a later point in time.

*NB:* This tool is in very early stages of development.

## How to use

```code

  ResourceCli [command]

Available Commands:
  --create -title <Title> -content <Content>   Add an entry to the database.
